# Manageify

# What it Does
The main motive of our project is basically to increase the productivity of the user.
Keeping track of all the deadlines and not being able to remember the useful information that may be required at 
important times can be harmful for a student.

Our project focuses on both these things. We provide the facility to create calender events which will provide you 
a notification few minutes before the event.

The second important thing that our project provides is the facility to create notes.
Users can create notes, the notes can be updated or deleted as they wish.
The calendar is accessed by using the google Calendar API.
